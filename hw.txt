Assignment 9: SSH setup and use in applications

1. In this scenario, my resulting network would still be secure. The messages arer still encrypted by the public keys. 
Our computers have the private keys to be able to decrypt the messages, so they can not decrypt our messages.

(1) If the other teams had tapped our keyboards and obtained the keystrokes, then the network would end up insecure. They would have access to the passphrase.
This means that they could decrypt all data and log in and access files.

(2) If they had access to the USB, the answer would also change. The network definitely won't be secure.
They will have access to the ssh folder and be able to access the private key.
They can decrypt the messages

2. gpg --verify can not verify the ownership. All it does is compare the decrypted signature to the decrypted data. 
As a result, the attacker can change the information for the message and then make a detached signature that matches another file. 

I would probably entrust a third party to keep track of my public key. They would be able to use a certificate to maintain a record of the original file.
This way, if the data is tampered with, we would know that someone has edited the file.
