1. du -sh ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
The total amount of disk space used for the working files in this directory is 509M bytes, or 509MB
du -sh .git
The total amount of disk space used for the working files in .git is 350M bytes, or 350MB
By doing du .git we can see the distribution of how much disk space is used for what
The .git/objects take up the most space because the objects directory stores all the content for your database

2. git branch --list -r | wc -l
We see that the number of remote branches is 177
git branch --list | wc -l
We see that the number of local branches is 176

3. git remote
Running this command shows us all of the remote repositories, which turns out to only be origin.
git remote show 
Output:
origin
Running this command shows us where origin is from as well as the branches
Output:
remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git
  Push  URL: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git 

4. git for-each-ref --count=10 --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/
This command was used to print the 10 local branches that were mosts recently commited to.
Output:

5. git rev-list --count master
This returns the count for commits in the master branch
Output:
139583

6. git rev-list --count --all
This returns the count for commits for any braanch
Output
143910
The percentage of commitss that are in the master branch can be calculated with 139583/143910*100% = 96.993%

7. git shortlog -s -n --since=2013-01-01
This command gives a "summarized" list of the git log output. It allows us to see which ten people authored the most commit sfrom 2013 and later and how many
Output:
