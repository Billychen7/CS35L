1.ssh lijay@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
Enter lnxsrv09 to see if we can enter lnxsrv07 using key

2. ssh-keygen
Generate a key, and I  left it in /.ssh/id_rsa, the default path. 
Entered a passphrase and saved it
Output:
Your identification has been saved in /u/ms/ugrad/lijay/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /u/ms/ugrad/lijay/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:PFnDgUvkQjphrJ2FyxlaBcs6kitn1mMoSPjDh2ysdmQ lijay@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|   .++o....      |
|   o==..o. .     |
|   *=*....+      |
|..o.*. o.o .     |
|+.o     S        |
|oB E     .       |
|= / =            |
|.O = .           |

ls -l ~/.ssh
Here we see what is created in the .ssh directory when we call this and this is 
-rw------- 1 lijay msugrad  410 Mar 11 23:18 authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 lijay msugrad 1766 Mar 11 23:10 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 lijay msugrad  410 Mar 11 23:10 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 lijay msugrad  977 Mar 12 02:11 known_hosts
We can also see that we have read and write permissions


3. ssh-copy-id lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
This command installs an SSH key on a server as an authorized key.
The command modifies the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
Output:
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/u/ms/ugrad/lijay/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

4. ssh lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
Now we test to see if the key works. This command prompts us to enter the passphrase.
This leads us into lnxsrv07, so we know the key worked. 

5. ssh lijay@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
After exiting lnxsrv07(dropping all connections), we go back into lnxsrv09 to see if we can use ssh-agent.

6. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add
We start the ssh-agent in the client and add our private key to the ssh-agent

7. ssh lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
This time, when we use ssh into lnxsrv07, we are not prompted for a passphrase.

8. ssh -X lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
xeyes
By running ssh -X and xeyes, we are able to see a graphic window with eyes that follow the mouse in all directions. 

9. ssh -A lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
ssh -A lnxsrv09
ssh -A lnxsrv10
By using ssh -A, we are able to enable agent forwarding. By doing this, we can perform multihop/daisy chain. By simply imputting the passphrase, we can easily switch between linux servers
