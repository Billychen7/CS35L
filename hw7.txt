1. git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutilshw7
cd diffutilshw7
git checkout v3.0 -b quote
We check out 3.0 into a new branch named quote
We get the following output:
Switched to a new branch 'quote'

2.patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt
We install our patch onto this new branch 
We get the following output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

3. Learn how to use  add-change-log-entry-other-window 

4. emacs fileName
C-x 4 a
C-x C-c

We used the add-change-log-entry-other-window to create a ChngeLog entry for our patch adapting the original change log.
We open the 6 files using emacs
Then we pasted thee content from the origanl entry in git-log.txt

5. git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog
We commit our changes and get the following output:

6. Test using new repository
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutilshw7test
cd diffutilshw7test
git checkout v3.0 -b quote
git am < ~/diffutilshw7/formatted-patch.txt
./bootstrap
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff 
./configure
make
make check
Here we make a whole new repository to test our patch works
We apply the patch using git am and build the result
Then, we check if it works using make check

7. make distdir
cd diffutils-3.0.1-a360 
emacs ChangeLog
To make sure that our ChangLog entry works, we run the make distdir command and look at the ChangeLog file.
 We can see our formatted patch ChangeLog

8. ssh -x lijay@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

The first thing that was noticed was that the screen is divided into windows. Top Row:
	Left: Here is a record of all of the commits in list view, as well as their corresponding relationships with branches
	Middle: Here we see the author of each coommit and their email address
	Right: This window shows the date of each commit
Middle Bar: Here we see the SHA1 ID for each commit and thier row and a search bar
Bottom Row:
	Left: Here we see the details of the commit that we select, showing the changelog of the commits
	Right: Here we see which files were modified by the commit
